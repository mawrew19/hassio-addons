This is inspired by DropBox Sync addon: https://github.com/danielwelch/hassio-addons
This is still a work-in-progress, so please treat it as such.

The use of AWS and S3 is NOT a free service, please be aware of that fact prior to moving forward.

To get this to work you will need an AWS account (free) and you will need to setup your own S3 bucket (not free when we start moving data).
Additionally, you will need to setup a user in AWS IAM which has access to your new S3 bucket. This bucket should NOT be made public.

A more thorough guide will be coming.
